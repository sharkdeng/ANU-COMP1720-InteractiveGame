# assets folder

This is where you should put any assets (e.g. image files, audio files) which
you use in your sketch. Make sure you commit the asset file in git (otherwise it
won't get pushed to the server, so it won't work at the test URL)

This should be completed automatically with a "Git: Commit All" command in the
VSCode command palette, however you can also do it manually from the base repo
with this command:

``` shell
git add assets/whatever-the-filename-is.jpg
```
