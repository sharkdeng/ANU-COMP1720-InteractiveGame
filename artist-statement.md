My story is Protect the Ocean to realize listening in and listening out.
In 2119 (scene 1), there is only one fish left in the world. By listening to what the fish is saying, you will have a general idea of what happens. 
So much rubbish pollutes the ocean, causing fish extinction. The only fish is in danger because he is sick due to loneliness. The only way to save him is to travel back to bring back his friends. 

In 2019 (scene 2), a lecture is undergoing. The lecturer called Tom is delivering a workshop titled "Fish extinction caused by ocean pollution". Nice landing! you may find helpful information here to figure out how you can save the fish. 
By listening to what the lecturers and students are discussing, you have some ideas. 

In 1919 (scene 3), you have traveled back 100 years again. Now the ocean still has some fish. Good! They are still alive. But they are in danger. It's time to save them! 

On the surface of the ocean (scene 3 - layer 1). An octopus is trapped in the rubbish. You heard its yelling "help me!". You find a net on the boat. Great! No worries! I am coming to you. You use the net to collect the rubbish and the octopus is freed. 

Then you swim down the ocean (scene 3 - layer 2). A crab wants to enjoy the sunlight but so much rubbish surrounds him. How to save him? You find a cannon beside. Although it's old, never mind, just try it! You start the cannon. It's working! The project hit the rubbish and destroy them. Wonderful. You saved the crab.

Then you keep swimming (scene 3 - layer 3). A ferocious shark is starving. He can't find food, with the rubbish hill forward. You use your hand to move this rubbish. A little fish is swimming. Nice, now the shark has something to eat. 

After saying goodbye to the shark, you come to the fourth layer of the ocean (scene 3 - layer 4). A little golden fish, shy and lovely. But she is scared now because she is blind by the rubbish that she can't find any trace of her friends. You swim there and use your nose to chase away this rubbish. Her vision is here. Her friends are just meters away! She feels so happy now!

Now is layer 5, a nice fish is so anxious that he sees a bunch of rubbish will hur her friends, a group of penguin. You find a magnet float nearby, you use that to attract the rubbish. In the meantime, you shout to warn those penguin. 

In layer 6 (scene 3 - layer 6), a fish has an abnormal giant brain because he accidentally ate some rubbish. He feels very bad. You use medicine to move the rubbish from him. He is saved. So close! Luckily you show up in time. I am sure you can save them all!

In layer 7 (scene 3 - layer 7), the water here is so dirty. You can barely see something. A giant fish is also complaining that. You heard that. You open the nearby fan and blow away all the rubbish. The water becomes clean again and the giant fish feel happy now. 

Finally, you come to the last layer (scene 3 - layer 8), you see nothing here. It's all black. But a twist of light is shining. Yu can't resist touching the light. Coming close and you see clearly now, a lantern fish can't go home because the way is blocked. You remove this rubbish and the fish is saved. 

After saving 8 fish, you swim back to the surface. A canvas is unlocked. You are thrilled to draw down your feeling. Really, really don't let rubbish hurt fish anymore. You have seen what the fish are suffering. 

Time to go back. You go back to 2019. The lecture is still on. But the sage lecturer know what you've done. You are greeted by them. You feel tired and want some rest, but you want see how's the only fish in the future, in 2119. So you start the time machine again and you find very happily the fish is not the only one in the world, there are 9 fish in the world now. The previous only fish thanks you but warns you more challenge are waiting.

You feel alert again. Although you are tired, you are ready now.
